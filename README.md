# ConvMixer
ConvMixer is a convolutional neural network architecture introduced in the paper "Patches Are All You Need?" by Soham De, Xuanyi Dong, Satwik Kottur, and Daniela Rus.

#Architecture
The ConvMixer architecture replaces the self-attention mechanism commonly used in transformer-based models with depthwise convolutional layers. This makes the architecture more computationally efficient and easier to parallelize, while still achieving state-of-the-art performance on several computer vision tasks.
