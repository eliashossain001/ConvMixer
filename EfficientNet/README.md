# EfficientNet with Keras

This is an implementation of the EfficientNet model in Keras, trained on the ImageNet dataset.

EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural networks that have been optimized for both accuracy and computational efficiency. These models have been shown to outperform previous state-of-the-art models on a variety of image recognition benchmarks, while using significantly fewer parameters and less computation.

# Requirements
* Python 3.6 or later
* TensorFlow 2.4 or later
* Keras 2.4 or later

# Installation

Clone the repository

'''
git clone https://github.com/username/efficientnet.git
cd efficientnet

'''

Install the required packages:

'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

# Usage

To train the model on the ImageNet dataset, run the following command:

'''
python train.py
'''

This will , preprocess the images, and train the model for 100 epochs. By default, the script will save the best model weights to a file called best_model.h5.
